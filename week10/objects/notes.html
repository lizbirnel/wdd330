      <h2>Chapter 9 The Window Object</h2>

      <section>
        <p>
          -Window object is the browser's global object, which represents the
          browser window that contains a web page
        </p>
        <h3>Browser Object Model</h3>
        <p>
          - a collection of properties and methods that contain info about
          browser and computer screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          -We can find out which browser is being used to view a page, find ou
          the dimensions of screen it's viewed on, and which pages have been
          visited before the current page. Can also creeate pop-up windows
          (annoy your users! Ha!)
        </p>
        <p>
          -No official standard for BOM, but there are a number of
          properties/methods supported by all major browsers making some sort of
          standards. They're available through the window object. Every browser
          window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object
        </p>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p>
          -Global variables are actual properties of a global object. Globals are
          created without const, let, or var keywords, and can be accessed in
          all parts of the program
        </p>
        <p>In browser, the global object is the window object.</p>
        <p>
          -parseInt() and isNaN() are methods of the global object or the window
          object. Full way to write is window.parseInt(4.2), but we usually
          shorten to parseInt() only.
        </p>
        <h3>Browser History</h3>
        <p>
          - Window history property can be used to access info about any
          previously visited pages in current browser session
        </p>
        <p>
          - window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited
          before the current page
        </p>
        <p>
          - window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page (0 is
          current page)
        </p>
        <p>
          - windowhistory.go(1); will go forward 1 page. <br />
          - window.history.go(0); reloads current page. <br />
          - window.history.go(-1); goes back 1 page.
        </p>
        <p>
          - also can use window.history.forward() and window.history.back()
          methods
        </p>
        <h3>Screen Info</h3>
        <p>
          - window.screen object contains info about the screen the browser is
          displayed on. Find height and width of screen in pixels using height
          and width properties. (window.screen.height, and window.screen.width)
        </p>
        <p>
          - availHeight and availWidth can be used to find height and width
          excluding operating system menus. window.screen.availWidth and
          window.screen.availHeight
        </p>
        <p>
          - colorDepth can find the color bit depth of the user's monitor (mostly
          used for statistics) window.screen.colorDepth;
        </p>
        <h3>Document Object</h3>
        <p>
          - Each window contains document object. This has properties ad methods
          that deal with page that has been loaded into the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          - document.write() method writes string of text to the page. If a page
          is already loaded it completely replaces current document
        </p>
        <p>- You can add html as part of the document.write string.</p>
        <p>
          - document.write() is not popular to use, highly frowned upon because it
          can only be used by mixing JS in an HTML document
        </p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>- Cookies are small files saved locally on user's computer.</p>
        <p>
          - Browsers don't remember anything from one request to another, so every
          time a user visits a page, nothing is rmembered.
        </p>
        <p>
          - cookies are used to sidestep the problem and store info that can be
          retrieved between requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Cookies are restricted by only being read by a web page from the same
          domain that set them. This stops sites being able to access info about
          users from other sites they've visited.
        </p>
        <p>
          - cookies are limited to storing up to 4kb of data, but 20 cookies are
          allowed per domain, so sometimes a lot of data
        </p>
        <p>
          - can be used for personalizing user's browsing experience to store user
          prefereneces, keep tack of choices (like a shopping cart)
        </p>
        <p>
          - to create a cookie, assign it to JavaScript "cookie jar" using
          document.cookie property
        </p>
        <p>- document.cookie acts like a special type of string.</p>
        <p>
          - To change a cookie value, reassign it to document.cookie using the
          same name with a different value.
        </p>
        <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
        <p>
          - setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as first
          parameter and number of milliseconds as its second parameter.
        </p>
        <p>- clearTimeout() method cancels the timeout.</p>
        <p>
          - setInterval() is similar to setTimeout but it repeatedly invokes
          callback function after those seconds.
        </p>
        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p>
          - setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements
          on a web page.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 14 HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <h3>HTML5</h3>
        <p>- W3C plans to develop future versions of HTML5 much more frequently than previously. HTML5.1 has already become latest and 5.2 is in development.</p>
        <h3>Data- Attribute</h3>
        <p>- data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page with custom attributes that are ignored by browser, and are private to a page </p>
        <p>- Their sole purpose is to be used by JavaScript program. Perfect for adding data that can be used as hook to access info about particular element on page</p>
        <p>- names of attributes must include format: 
          <ul><li>start with data-</li>
          <li>contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons, or underscores</li>
        <li>include an optional string value</li></ul>
        </p>
        <p>- each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attribute</p>
        <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
        <p>- HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help gain access to hardware like cameras, batteries, geolocation and graphics card. </p>
        <h3>HTML5 Web Storage</h3>
        <p> - web storage API provides key-value store on client's computer similar to using cookies, but has more storage capapcity and is easier to use. </p>
        <p>- good for storing info about users, and storing application-specific info to be used during future sessions </p>
        <p>- different than cookies because info is not shared with server on every request, info is available in multiple windows of browser if domain is the same, and storage capacity limit is much greater than cookies.</p>
        <p>- if a browser supports Web Storage API, window object will have property called localStorage. Also a sessionStorage object that works the same way, but stores data for only the current session</p>
        <p>- instead of using getItem() and setItem() methods, you can assign them instead with localStorage.name, for example</p>
        <p>- remove from local storage by using removeItem (localStorage.removeItem('name');</p>
        <p>- delete local storage by using delete localStorage.name;</p>
        <p>- clear everything or completely remove everything by using the clear() method-- localStorage.clear();</p>
        <h3>Geolocation</h3>
        <p>- Geolocation API used to obtain geographical postiion of device. It can find the exact location, and link to nearby places or measure speed at which user is moving. Crazy!</p>
        <p>- example would be a search by location</p>
        <p>- with privacy concerns, user must grant permission first!</p>
        <p>- has several properties to find information about location and movement, like speed, altitude, heading, and timestamp. </p>
        <h3>Web Workers</h3>
        <p>- allow processes to be run in the background. </p>
        <p>- use Worker() constructor function to create a new worker</p>
        <p>- use postMessage() to send message and start worker working</p>
        <p>- when worker has completed task, it can be stopped using terminate() method</p>
        <h3>Websockets</h3>
        <p>- new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.</p>
        <p><a href="websocket.html">Websocket Example Here</a></p>
        <h3>Multimedia</h3>
        <p>- Audio clips can be inserted into page with audio tag, using src attribute to point to audio file</p>
        <p>- video clips are inserted with video tag and src attribute</p>
        <p>- content inside audio or video tags will only display if browser doesn't support them. Controls attribute can be added wihtout any value and will display native play, pause, and volumen controls. </p>
        <p>- play(), pause(), and volume methods and properties can be used</p>
        <h3>Drawing with Canvas</h3>
        <p>- canvas element allows graphics to be drawn onto web page in real time with JS. </p>
        <canvas id='canvas' width='400' height='400'>Sorry, but your browser does not support the canvas element</canvas>


        <script>
          const canvasElement = document.getElementById('canvas');
          const context = canvasElement.getContext('2d');
          context.fillStyle = "#0000cc"; // a blue fill color 
context.strokeStyle = "#ccc"; // a gray stroke color
context.lineWidth = 4;
context.fillRect(10,10,100,50);
context.strokeRect(10,100,100,50);

context.beginPath();
context.moveTo(130, 50);
context.lineTo(180, 50);
context.moveTo(155, 50);
context.lineTo(155, 90);
context.strokeStyle = '#c00';
context.lineWidth = 15;
context.stroke();

context.beginPath();
context.arc(200, 200, 30, 0, Math.PI * 2, false);
context.strokeStyle = '#ff0';
context.lineWidth = 4;
context.stroke();

context.fillStyle = '#0c0'; // a blue fill color
context.font = 'bold 26px Playfair Display sans-serif';
context.fillText('Hello', 20, 200);
