      <h2>Chapter 9 The Window Object</h2>

      <section>
        <p>
          Window object is the browser's global object, which represents the
          browser window that contains a web page
        </p>
        <h3>Browser Object Model</h3>
        <p>
          - a collection of properties and methods that contain info about
          browser and computer screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can find out which browser is being used to view a page, find ou
          the dimensions of screen it's viewed on, and which pages have been
          visited before the current page. Can also creeate pop-up windows
          (annoy your users! Ha!)
        </p>
        <p>
          No official standard for BOM, but there are a number of
          properties/methods supported by all major browsers making some sort of
          standards. They're available through the window object. Every browser
          window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object
        </p>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p>
          Global variables are actual properties of a global object. Globals are
          created without const, let, or var keywords, and can be accessed in
          all parts of the program
        </p>
        <p>In browser, the global object is the window object.</p>
        <p>
          parseInt() and isNaN() are methods of the global object or the window
          object. Full way to write is window.parseInt(4.2), but we usually
          shorten to parseInt() only.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Chapter 14 HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <h3>Canvas</h3>
        <p>-we can draw anything through JavaScript!</p>

        <script>
          var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas5");
          var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
          ctx.font = "30px Playfair Display";
          ctx.fillStyle = "red";
          ctx.textAlign = "center";
          ctx.fillText("Hello World", canvas.width / 2, canvas.height / 2);
        </script>
