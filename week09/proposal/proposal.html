        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a culmination of what I've been learning for this
          semester, with more detailed work in HTML, CSS, and in depth
          JavaScript features. For this project, I wanted to bring as many of
          the new skills I've been working on as possible and to create a
          challenge for me to learn as I develop these ideas. As I brainstormed
          ideas, I came up with the idea of an application that I could use with
          my elementary school students in the music classroom where I work.
          After school going online last year, I was looking for fun ideas to
          help students learn and interact with music concepts I teach in the
          classroom over their computers. Even back in the classroom, every once
          in a while we have a computer day and play with music apps. I want to
          create an application that would have a few music activities I create,
          as well as link to some of our favorites and have a library all in one
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          This app I will create will have a few parts to it. First, I would use
          JavaScript to program a basic metronome. I'm hoping to be able to
          style it to look like a fun metronome that the user can select the
          different beats per minute and use for keeping a steady beat. We use
          this in the classroom frequently, and having one on my own app would
          be fun for students to get to set the beat themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part of the app is an interactive piano keyboard for
          students to play on. I have seen many different tutorials for how to
          create a piano with JavaScript and I'm excited for the challenge. This
          will use event listeners and pull notes/sounds from a Web Audio API
          library.
        </p>
        <p>
          A third section of the app will contain musical flashcards with
          information about musical instrument groups, composers, rhythm, and
          other facts taught in class. They would have a term on one side and
          flip over to have the definition, or more detail on the back. This
          will either use data pulled from an external API source, or pull from
          a JSON file of my own creating. I will use JavaScript to create the
          cards on the page, and then style them with CSS and transforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last, I'd like to make use of the drum sounds we used for a team
          activity this semester and program a drum set for the app. I will
          style it to match the elementary classroom theme, fitting better with
          the feel of the page. Depending on the time each of these activities
          takes, I might work on adding in more musical instrument features to
          be used in the app as well.

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The audience for this app is mainly my elementary music students, from
          Kindergarten to 6th graders, so age 5-12 years old.

        <h2>Color Palette</h2>
        <p>
          The color palette for this web application is mostly fun rainbow
          inspired primary and secondary colors that can be found in an
          elementay school classroom. The colors are bright and vivid and
          engaging for the specific audience for this application. They will
          help add to the fun nature of the games and information presented, and
          be appropriate for the setting in which this app will be used.

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          To keep with the playful nature of an elementary school music room, I
          wanted a fun header font that will be light and fun, but not the
          ever-common font that is used on every worksheet that comes with my
          kids from school (No Comic Sans! Courtesy of every design class I've
          had in my college education... ha!)<br />I've chosen to use Bubblegum
          Sans from Google Fonts for headers, and Lato, a sans-serif font for
          body copy that is easy to read.
        </p>
        <h3>Bubblegum Sans for headers</h3>

        <h2>Initial Module List</h2>
        <p>
          I am still working through the organization of the modules in my mind
          for how to manage the different scripts necessary for these
          activities. I think I will have a separate JS file for each activity,
          one for the piano, one for the metronome, a JSON file for the
          flashcards, etc. I think I will probably work this list out more as I
          create each activity.

        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>
          I have a few weeks to work on this project and want to use my time as
          effectively as possible in order to create a complete and
          well-designed web application. Here is a basic structure/schedule that
          is my initial plan to follow in order to accomplish all of these
          tasks. Hopefully this is a good break down, but subject to revision as
          needed depending on how much time it takes to work out the kinks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Week 10: Revise plans, finalize plans and research APIs for the
            piano keyboard and music facts. Begin building home view.
          </li>
          <li>
            Week 11: Build Metronome and Piano Keyboard functionality, begin to
            style them
          </li>
          <li>
            Week 12: Build Flashcards section and Drums page (or other
            instruments page). Finish styling pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Week 13: Finalize styling to make everything polished and looking
            beautiful. Test and troubleshoot everything, tie up loose ends and
            add transforms/transitions for increased user fun.
