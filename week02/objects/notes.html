    <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2 Programming Basics</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Commenting in Javascript: Single line comments use // for the entire
        line to be commented out. Multi-line comments start with /* and end with
        */
      </li>
      <li>
        Reserved Words in js are words that are reserved for the syntax of the
        language and not allowed to be used to name variables or function
        parameters. (Some include: abstract, boolean, break, catch, class,
        const, continue, delete, double, false, function, import, etc. )
      </li>
      <li>
        Datatypes of Javascript: String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined,
        Null (Primitive datatypes), and Object (Non-primitive).
      </li>
      <li>
        Variables must be declared before being assigned. You can assign
        multiple variables on a single line separated by commas. Variables
        declared with keyword "let" may be reassigned later. Variables declared
        using keyword "const" means they actually aren't variable and cannot be
        reassigned. Values inside of a non-primitive type CAN be changed even if
        declared with const. (like a name within an array as opposed to a name
        set as a constant in a primitive type). Var can still be used to declare
        a variable, but is older and not as current in its scope. Let is the
        replacement for Var in most cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scope: Block scoped is variables that only exist inside the block they
        are declared in.<strong> Global Scope </strong>is any variable declared
        ouside of a block. It can be accessed and used anywhere in the program.
        Not the best practice, global variables are kept to a minimum for best
        practices (easy to forget the name of all variables used, and you cannot
        use the same name or risk overriding another one at global scope.)
        <strong>Local Scope</strong> is any variable established with Let or
        Const defined within a block.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use basic math arithmetic operations in javascript (addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, etc). It will follow
        order of operations (PEMDAS)
      </li>
      <li>
        Logical Operators- can be used wtih any primitive value or object. Based
        on whether truthy or falsy. Logical Not (!), Logical AND (&&), and
        Logical OR (||)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chapter 3 Arays, Logic, and Loops</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Arrays are ordered lists of values. Create an array by using square
        brackets and input data separated by commas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Array literals can be created by assigning many values in the initial
        array creation
      </li>
      <li>
        You can adjust length of array, add values, delete values, manipulate
        the data. Pop removes last item from array. Shift method removes first
        item in array. Push method appends new value to the end of array.
        Unshift method appends new item to the beginning of the array.
      </li>
      <li>
        Merging Arrays: concat() method merges with one or more arrays. Join()
        method also works, using &. Slicing and Splicing creates a subarray.
        Slicing takes the positions you ask for. Splicing removes itms and puts
        new ones in their place. Splice method is destructive by writing over
        what already existed. Can also be non-destructive and simply add a new
        value at a certain position, moving everything back a position.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrays can be reversed with reverse() method. Sorted with sort() method.
        You can find a value in an array by using indexOf() method, or
        includes() method.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multidimensional Arrays are arrays of arrays. (Inception, haha!)
        Coordinates are a good example of this. You can use the spread operator
        to nest arrays into another array.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sets are data structures that represent a collection of unique values
        and cannot have duplicate values. Sets are helpful because they keep
        track of data without having to check if values are duplicated. To
        create a set, use new operator and set() constructor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set Methods: Number of values in a set are found with size() method.
        Check to see if item is in set with has() method. Delete() method
        removes values from set. Clear() method removes all values from set.
        Sets can be converted to arrays with spread operator in array literal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maps are way to keep list of key and value pairs. Different from
        Javascript objects because maps can be any data type, while objects are
        limited to strings for key values. Maps are easy to find the number of
        key-value pairs with size property. Use get() method to get values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Logic: If statements, else statements, ternary operators (if...else
        statements shorthand), switch statements, loops, while loops, infinite
        loops, do...while loops, for loops, nested for loops,
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chapter 4 - Functions</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Functions are first-class objects that behave as primitive data types.
        Can be used inside variables, arrays, and returned by other functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Define a function by using function Declarations. Starts with funciton
        keyword, name of function, parantheses, and then block of code inside
        curly brackets {}
      </li>
      <li>
        Function Expressions: defined as an anonymous function by using const =
        function() syntax.
      </li>
      <li>DRY: Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</li>
      <li>
        Parameters and Arguments are used interchangeably--values provided for
        the function as input. Parameters are set when function is defined. When
        the function is called, it gets passed Arguments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Function Rest operator used to deal with multiple arguments: creates an
        array of arguments that are available inside the function. Use ... in
        front of last parameter in function declaration.
      </li>
      <li>Default parameters are what is used if no arguments are provided.</li>
      <li>
        Arrow Functions: Smaller syntax to declare a function. Identified by the
        'arrow' symbol ( => ). Parameters come before the arrow and main body of
        function comes after. Always anonymous, you must assign them to a
        variable to refer to them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Function and Variable hoisting; Howiting is moving all variable and
        function declarations to the top of curent scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Callbacks: functions that are passed as arguments are callbacks.
        (Functions that invoke other functions to complete)
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrays have methods that use callbacks. forEach() loop method will loop
        through array and invoke callback function using each value as an
        argument. Map() method is similar to forEach(). Goes over an array,
        takes callback function. Processes data returned from databases in array
        form. Map() method returns new array that replaces each value. Reduce()
        method works over array. Combines each result to return single value.
        Filter() method returns new array that has true items from original
        array when passed to callback.
      </li>
      
    </ul>
