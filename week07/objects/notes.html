        Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused system errors, programmer error, or user error
      </li>
      <li>
        An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. For example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent will result in a reference error that raises an exception
      </li>
      <li>
        A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This can be a problem because the program might continue to run incorrectly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use strict mode to help you find errors in your code.
