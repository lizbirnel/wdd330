    <h2>Week01</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Week 1 notes/exercises - Not very many notes this week.
        I read the section on localStorage and studied the different functions
        written for loading, saving, and displaying the story telling
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Created my portfolio site with Javascript dynamically populating the
        list of weekly assignments
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I haven't learned anything about localStorage before. Is this the most
        common way to remember data from pages for users? Is this what "cookies"
        do when they store the users' information for when they return to the
        page?
      </li>
      <li>
        Logistical question about the weekly assignments: Should I be having a
        separate link from this weekly page to something else? The example shown
        links to a non-existent page, so I'm not sure what I should be adding
        here if anything is needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow-up Logistical Question: Do I need to style these weekly
        assignments with CSS? I haven't put a lot in this week, but I will take
        the time to do so if that is important.
